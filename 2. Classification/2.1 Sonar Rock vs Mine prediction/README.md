## Sonar Rock vs Mine prediction 
### 1.Background :
 Suppose there is a war between countries and we have assigned submarines to check whether there is rock or a mine inside water.
Mines are explosives that explode when some object come in contact with it.
And there can be rocks as well in the ocean.

### 2.Gools:
In this project i will predict whether it is crossing a mine or a rock. So, we have to build a system to predict whether the object beneath the submarine is mine or rock.
 
### 3.Tools:
I will use in this project:
1- Numpy is a python library for scientific computing.
2- Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
3- sklearn is a simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis. 

### 4.Steps:
