# Sonar Rock vs Mine prediction 
## 1.Background :
 Suppose there is a war between countries and we have assigned submarines to check whether there is rock or a mine inside water.
Mines are explosives that explode when some object come in contact with it.
And there can be rocks as well in the ocean.

## 2.Gools:
In this project i will predict whether it is crossing a mine or a rock. So, we have to build a system to predict whether the object beneath the submarine is mine or rock.
 
## 3.Tools:
I will use in this project:
1- Numpy is a python library for scientific computing.
2- Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
3- sklearn is a simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis. 

## 4.Steps:
### - Dataset:
The dataset used is the sonar Rock vs Mine prediction from Kaggle. 
### - Loading data by using pandas 
### - Train Test Split:
I will train the model with 90% of
training-data and 10% will be used to test-data. And evaluate the model
with the help of test-data.
### - Model Fitting:
I will use the supervised learning algorithm of logistic regression model because, this model works very well for Binary Classification Problem. It is a Binary Classification Problem (Rock or a Mine).
### - Accuracy on the training and test data.
